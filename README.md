Wordly is a simple word game.The game challenges the user to transform a given start word to a given end word
by changing only one letter at a time. For example, starting from the word “cute” transform to the word to “cope.” 
Each time after changing one letter, you must arrive at another valid word. The app gives the start word and the 
end word to the user.
